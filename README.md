# Solidity Ethereum Smart Contract for Reward/Punishment for Good/Bad Driver Behaviour

Solidity Smart contract part of the [Chorus Mobility - Good Driving Behaviour Android Demo](https://github.com/chorusmobility/driver-behavior-android-ethereum-app). The smart contract implements an algorithm that calculates the driver behaviour score sent by the mobile phone application. The reward or punishment is derived accordingly. This light version of the contract is a proof of concept prototype. The current version relies on one main and 4 additional characteristics of driver behaviour that are used to calculate the score.
